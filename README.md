🚨 The Problem
India's infrastructure crisis in numbers:
IssueImpactAnnual losses from infrastructure failures₹30,000+ CroreAccidents yearly from road defects150,000+Average complaint resolution time30-60 daysEngineer time wasted on paperwork40%Citizens with zero complaint visibility100%Predictive maintenance capability0%
Current systems just log complaints. They don't think. They don't predict. They don't prioritize.

💡 Our Solution
BuildSense AI is not another complaint management app.
We are an AI Infrastructure Risk Intelligence Engine that transforms governance:
Traditional Approach              BuildSense AI
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Someone reports pothole     →     AI detects + quantifies risk score
Manual inspection queue     →     Dynamic priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
Engineer guesses priority   →     82/100 risk score with explanation
Reactive firefighting       →     Predicts failures 60 days in advance
No citizen visibility       →     Amazon-style real-time tracking
Paper-heavy documentation   →     AI co-pilot auto-generates reports
Politics-driven budgets     →     Data-driven resource allocation
→ See complete solution details in Requirements Doc
